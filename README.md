Smart RFID Attendance System with GSM Alerts & SD Card Backup

üß† Project Overview

This system uses two Arduino boards to automate student attendance marking using RFID cards.

 * UNO 1 (Master) handles RFID scanning and GSM communication to send SMS alerts to parents in real-time.
 * UNO 2 (Slave) manages LCD display, EEPROM, and SD card storage for daily attendance logging.
  
Both Arduinos communicate via I¬≤C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication.

‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

üîπ Arduino UNO 1 (Master)

 * Reads RFID card UIDs via MFRC522 module (SPI)
 * Sends the UID to UNO 2 using I¬≤C
 * Sends SMS notifications to parents using GSM module
 * Keeps track of period-wise attendance
 * Sends a daily summary SMS at the end of the day
   
üîπ Arduino UNO 2 (Slave)

 * Receives the UID from UNO 1 via I¬≤C
 * Displays current period and student name on I¬≤C LCD
 * Logs attendance data to an SD card
 * Stores attendance data in EEPROM for backup in case of power failure

üß† How the System Works

üî∏ Step 1: Initialization

 * Both Arduinos boot up.
 * UNO 1 initializes RFID and GSM modules.
 * UNO 2 initializes the LCD, SD card, and EEPROM memory.

üî∏ Step 2: Period Timing

 * Each class period is simulated as 10 seconds (periodDuration = 10000).
 * UNO 1 automatically increments the currentPeriod after every 10 seconds.
 * UNO 2 also keeps track of the same.

üî∏ Step 3: RFID Scan

 * A student scans their RFID card.
 * UNO 1 reads the card‚Äôs UID and identifies the student.
 * It marks the student as present for the current period.
 * It sends an SMS notification to the student‚Äôs parent using the GSM module.
 * It also sends the UID to UNO 2 via I¬≤C.

üî∏ Step 4: LCD Display and Logging

 * UNO 2 displays the current period and student‚Äôs name on the LCD.
 * It marks attendance in its EEPROM and logs data to the SD card.

üî∏ Step 5: Daily Summary

 * After the final period (8th), UNO 1 automatically sends a daily summary SMS to all parents.
 * UNO 2 stores the complete attendance data in a file named DAY1.TXT on the SD card.
