📘 Project Title

Smart RFID Attendance System with GSM Alerts & SD Card Backup

🧠 Project Overview

This system uses two Arduino boards to automate student attendance marking using RFID cards.

 * UNO 1 (Master) handles RFID scanning and GSM communication to send SMS alerts to parents in real-time.
 * UNO 2 (Slave) manages LCD display, EEPROM, and SD card storage for daily attendance logging.
  
Both Arduinos communicate via I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication.

⚙️ System Architecture

🔹 Arduino UNO 1 (Master)

 * Reads RFID card UIDs via MFRC522 module (SPI)
 * Sends the UID to UNO 2 using I²C
 * Sends SMS notifications to parents using GSM module
 * Keeps track of period-wise attendance
 * Sends a daily summary SMS at the end of the day
   
🔹 Arduino UNO 2 (Slave)

 * Receives the UID from UNO 1 via I²C
 * Displays current period and student name on I²C LCD
 * Logs attendance data to an SD card
 * Stores attendance data in EEPROM for backup in case of power failure
