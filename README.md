Smart RFID Attendance System with GSM Alerts & SD Card Backup

ðŸ§  Project Overview

This system uses two Arduino boards to automate student attendance marking using RFID cards.
  UNO 1 (Master) handles RFID scanning and GSM communication to send SMS alerts to parents in real-time.
  UNO 2 (Slave) manages LCD display, EEPROM, and SD card storage for daily attendance logging.
Both Arduinos communicate via IÂ²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication.
